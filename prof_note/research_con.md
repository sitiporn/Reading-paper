# How to choose a good topic

* open problems
    L researchers think is important instead of what we think

* Relevancy 
    L trying to do thing -> still alive in 10 years
    L what I want in the future -> think about it still active in 3 years or more than that 

* List all possible question -> To check feasibility -> being conveneint

  * Do I have skill sets  ?
  * Do I have the datasets ?  

  * Try to attack small problem but significant 


**For example
    L studying well-known with the well-established methods but with slight change in the factors being studied -> trainning that requires tacking even harder problems

   * may be investigating one or two factors deeply  

   * what are the state-of-the-art problems in a research area ?
   * Try to select one recent papers you most interested and nearest what I wana do 

   * select papers the same confernece papers that we wana publish 
    make sure it's really good 
   
   * try understand little detail
          L implentation 
          L experiment design 

 ** Tips
     
     * Try to think what their limitation of papers (eg. * future work, limitation )   
     * How can I do differently  
     * High level copy -> writting style , experimental design, related work    
             * must know what to coppy 
important points to remembers 

  * please dont make-up some problems so that I can argue for the need of a solution 
       * Think deeply is this really a problem
       * It worth solving ?
       * the result be too obvious such that there is no impact ? 
       * research thing -> I can do it at least 10 years 
       * explore things exist follow it rigorously
       * I have to think about something new and have a benefits towards researchers, users, industries

# How to find related work efficiently

 * snowballing and backtracking techqiue:
    
    * find state of art -> few papers and often published the flagship confand with in last few year 
        * unsure -> ask prof

     * 1) what are the related work they commonly **cited(snowballing)
       2) what are the related work that commonly **cites them (backtracking)

     * build network that important in my feild 
     * how most network relate their own work with these related work.
     * find - 1-5 key papers, while the rest 10+ are more like supporting papers
     * find gurus website see their publication that match my work
