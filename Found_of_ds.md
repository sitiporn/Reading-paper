1) Law of Large Numbers

   - Random varible 
      eg. sample tall some people in Bangkok
   - the average of sampling samples would be closed to the expectation of that varibles
   - eg.
           random experiment ->  X   , expectation -> avg
           eg1
               coin experiment -> H 0 , T 1  -> avg 0.5

           eg2    samples ->  1,0,1,0,0,... -> finding the average which is closet to 0.5
