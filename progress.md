what are benefits of these deep learning tools ? 

- attention
   L it can help models to see the relevant information 
- self supervised
   L  imitate the ways that humans classify objects
   L (pretext tasks) help to initialize the weights of networks which is useful for actual tasks (supervised / unsupervised tasks)
- one shot learning 
   L less data can help models to generalize even one sample.





1) Goals of this projects
2) problem of this proj
3) information that use to think 
4) if it works and if not in which is situation
5) Accodring to informatiopn How would  my conclusion be 
6) what aspects that we see / what can it be other aspects
7) How this conclusion answers our goals
8) How this ideas can be used and what would it be the benefits
