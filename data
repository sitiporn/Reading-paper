1. Are Pretrained Transformers Robust in Intent Classification? A Missing Ingredient in Evaluation of Out-of-Scope Intent Detection

 ** guess -> pretain transformers didnt robust in Out-of-Scope Intent 
            
 what is out of scope mean ?
  L the dialouge system are not supported   

 * what did authors try to accomplish ?
     L the problem in pretain models that are in-domain but out-of-scope 
            L ID-OOS examples
            L general out of scope  ** -> fined grained few-shot intent detefction tasks
 * what were the key element of the approach ?
 * what can you use yourself ?
 
   *** further work -> pretrained models are not robust on ID-OOS
    examples, and both the OOS detection tasks are
    challenging on the scenario of fine-grained intent
    detection.
  
 Out-of-scope (OOS) -> The request of user dont be expected or supported by the tested dialog system 
  
   * import to improve OOS intent detection while keeping in-scope in few-shot  
   
  OOS examples -> daset dont belong to any of known intent classes 

   * their reseach question -> Are pretained Transformers robust in intent classification 
   
   * ID-OOS , OD-OOS , ! ID = in-domanin OD = out-domanin 

  the problem -> pretained model are less robust on ID-OOS than in-scope and OD-OOS exameples; 

  subtask may be -> improve on OD-OOS and ID-OOS fined grained on few-shot detection 
  
  what is masking keywords shared among confusing intents
  
  why OOS examples can be considered as out of domains ? 
  
 CLINCâ€™s OOS <-> out-of-domain 


 OOS examples and the original Banking77 dataset


 OOS-OOS problem -> they cannot evaluate capability to detect OOS intents with same domains

 what are the targeted domains ? 

 OOD-OOS: out-of-domain OOS . General out-of-scope which are not supported by dialouge systems,also called out-of-domain eg. requesting NBA TV show service in banking system 

 
 ID-OOS: in-domain OOS, out-of-scope which are more related to in-scope intents <- challenge ! 
 eg. requesting a banking serviced that is not supported by the banking system. 

 :CLINIC dataset:
  - 10 domain select 15 intent for each
  - randomly select 2 domain from 10 domain to evaluate
                    L Banking
                    L Credit cards


 :The BANKING77: 
  
  - fined-grained single banking domain intent dataset with 77 intents
  
  - exclude OOS examples


  ** use to above dataset

     1) to detect OOS detection task 
     2) conduct the evaluation across dif domains and single larged fine-grained domain.
