# Metal-organics frameworks (MOFs)

How to control properties of MOFs
  
  L rational designs 
      L structure and composition 


Flexible MOFs and their different modes of flexibility
  L depend on properites


Structural Characterization of MOFs
  L XRD
     * use exernal stimuli then measure pattern
     * eg. layer pillar MOFs
     * what is isoterm 

Chemical stability
  L modify PH -> change the capacity of CO2
  L integrate pore and sensitiy -> increase capacity 
  

Selectivity for post-combustion CO2
   L control structure and composition
   L use calacteryzation tools 

begin
  L start rigid structure
