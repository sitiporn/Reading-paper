# Machine Learning in General 
# objective 

    1) know basic concept of ML
    2) know model representation 
    3) know some well-know learning algo
    4) see some programmimg works

#Data Analytics process 

1) bussiness question  -> Domain knowledge
    
2) Data aggregation 

3) Data Selection, cleanning and filtering 


4) Exploratory -> clean data 
     L Insight Derivation
     L Model Feasibility

#MOFs

Rational synthesis
  L select appropriate structure
  L Molecular Mechanics

* Geomery optimization 
* Hessian Calculation

* fitness MOF-FF 
    Hessian -> explain movement of atom in equilibrium point

* Bonding Terms
   * Bond Stretching Terms
        * Angle Terms

 Genetics Algorithm

 L 2 pow 64 posibiloty
 L optimize MOF-FF 
 L follow genetics algorithm

  * Some data analysis techniquies in chem
  * PCA

   
   Multivariate data analysis

   * (EDA) Exploratory data analysis 
       * Aim to detect  EDA is to detect the sim and disim
       * To answer:
               * Are there any grouping / cluster in the data?
               * Are there any outliers ? 


       * PCA 
---

   * study case no.1

     * UV-Vis
        *Idea
          to detect our sample detect which color from source light 

        * samples -> (39,31) 
---


       * PCA 

       (39,31) -> (39,2)

       * Multivariate
          * build a boundary
          * indentifies class region 


        * EDC 
            - find centroid of each class
            - find boundary
                  

        * PCA
