#summarize what I am talking with prof.

1) comparison and find good combination for 
   things  specfic case.
   eg. method A and models -> can use for this kind of problem C
           L what i/p should be for this kinds of combination 

2) find the models  that are the best in the state of art
          
           L modifying from them 
                     L may be objective function
                     L or gradient or something else  
                     L just two or three thing of specific part of them

           L quite be theory 


---------------------

3) method and proposal and coding talking on this thrusday

4) Habit of implementing papers
           

5) focused on intent classification, intent detection, intent recognition 
    
        L may be specific on joint filling and intent detection  

* guess joint filling can improve intent classification
