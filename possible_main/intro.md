   1.2) Problem Statement 
         
          * problem of intent detection datasets 
               * same semantic structure even they are different intent  
          * problem of in-scope and out-scope in dialog system 
               * if model cannot detect out-of-scope and falls into scope classes 
                    * dialog system may give wrong action    


          * all above problem related to production problem scenarios where data may be in limited or uneven supply or OOS query from users that why solving this problem are important becaue this one of core problem not only NLP and also natural language understanding  
  
   1.3) Reseach question 
         
         1) what are some of liguistic property factors that occur in the models which learn to be contrast relevant and irrelavant data that they can claim state of art  

         2) what are some of liguistic properties factor that occur in Model that learn on contrastive learning that make model misleading predict out-of-scope fall into in-scope intent  ? 

         3)  


              
    1.4)  Objectives of the study 
       
        
         1) to compare  effects of linguistic properties in-scope and out-of-scope intent datasets that learn on contrastive learning 

         2) to benefits towards few shot intent detection tasks
