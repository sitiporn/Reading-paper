      * intent detection dataset  
          * why this dataset is important ?  
      * Discriminative few shot intent detection 
          * Using Natural langugage inference  
      * contrastive learning  technique
          * Self supervised contrastive on Pretrain model  
          * Supervised contrastive on Fine tunning model


      * natural language understanding (probe linguistic structure)
          * Probe by visualize all attention head in Transformers base model  
          * Probe Vectors representaions of word 
       
 Implemented  
      * show model can be able to predict the intent
