# Research question 

## Problem statement 


1) problem of they are the diffent intent
   - on OOS dataset -> on diffent intent some have sematically similar utterances -> they cannot classify 

2) what if dialauge system doesn't support 
   - make them -> doesnt support
   - create new intent or new label  for them 
   - they dont have intent 


# Research question of literater review 
  
   OOS: the users request are not be supported by testing daiglog system  
    
    L OOS rately over-lap eg. requesting Tv shows in banking systems
    L separating ID-OOS  eg. requesting banking services that support by banking systems
    
     

    1) Are pretrannning Transformers robust in the intent classification transformers ? 
    2) Is the schema with both stages necessary?
    3) Is the training sensitive to hyper-parameters?  
    4) * whether self-supervised contrasive pre-trainning only target intent datasets benefits
